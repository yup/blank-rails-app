Blank Rails App
===============

Blank slate boilerplate Rails application. An alternative to the rails command.

Installing
==========

* git clone git://github.com/leethal/blank-rails-app.git
* mv blank-rails-app your-awesome-project
* cd your-awesome-project
* git submodule init
* git submodule add
* rake app:init
* rake test
* Make the tests pass

A note on making the tests pass. Some tests are flunked (read: failing) deliberately. It means that those parts has to be implemented on a per-app basis. This includes "what should happen after successful login" and other things. The tests themself should be pretty descriptive.

Notes
=====

* config/settings.yml contains app global settings. Any key added here will be available through SETTINGS, e.g. SETTINGS['foo']. Very convenient for API keys, deployment specific settings etc.
